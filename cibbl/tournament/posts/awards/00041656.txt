Good Day, CIBBL!
Spring has arrived, and CabalVision is proud to present the CIBBL Regional Competitions. However, before we do so, there are a number of other matters to discuss.

First of all, I would like to thank Burnalot for managing affairs during my absence. I was lurking around here and there during my time at Slaaneshii Pleasure Island, and I feel, er, much rejuvenated...

Before we go on, a list of teams will follow who are hereby reprimanded for not yet meeting CabalVision standards. The sponsors are not yet pleased. Teams will have 10 days from now to improve whatever is needed, if this deadline is not met, an official warning flag is issued. If after another 10 days the issues are not fixed, CabalVision/CIBBL will unfortunately have to revoke the licenses of said team and coach at that point.

Now, I would also like to take a moment to hand out the following Achievements.
Since these are Winter Achievements, these do not count for Prestige Points. Similar Achievements in the future will count for Prestige Points.


Winter\'s Glory - Awarded to teams which performed excellently during their matches in Winter. Team Achievement
* Ninja Warriors
* Secret Cult Of Shiamoto
* Lords of the Silent Death


Child of Winter - Awarded to top performing players during the matches played in Winter. Player Achievement
* Jessie Graff (Ninja Warriors)
* Tutencal the Harvester (Guardians of the Lurking God)
* Ronin Lethal Strike (Secret Cult Of Shiamoto)
* Mosstail (Seven Samples of Decay)
* Hazu (Secret Cult Of Shiamoto)

Please add these Achievements to your team biographies and/or player biographies. Not just because it looks nice, but because it is actually necessary to keep track of these Achievements in this league. If you need help in doing so, feel free to ask how.
