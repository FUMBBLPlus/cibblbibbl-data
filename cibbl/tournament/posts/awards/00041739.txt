Hello coaches!

Wow - the Chaos Wastelands are all wrapped up and finished! Let's see if we have any player awards to hand out there... Not too many hand out here, it seems, but there is always something!


Wasteland Warrior - Awarded to best players of the Chaos Wastelands Regionals. Worth 1 Prestige Point to the team as long as that player is on the team.

- Hypex (Pleasure Principle)
- Serpentin (Pleasure Principle)
- Arkh'gar (Crimson Skull)

And last but not least, the surprising entry of:

- Max Spleenripper (STAR PLAYER)

(Just so we are all clear how this works. These players are now look upon with extra regard by the CabalVision fans and CabalVision itself. They are worth Prestige as long as they are on the team. If they are ever retired or killed, the team drops in Prestige. What this means is that a coach might have to think carefully about when to retire such a player if they might carry injuries. In addition, the following should be noted by everyone: killing a player with an award like this is something worth your while.

And yes, it is important to note that there is an award on Max Spleenripper as well, even if he is not on a specific team.)


With that behind us, that means that we can now proceed with the Wasteland Regional rankings as follows:


Coven of the Mirrored Hall
- now placed at 1 Prestige Point -


Seven Samples of Decay
- now placed at 9 Prestige Point -


Pleasure Principle
- now placed at 13 Prestige Point -


Crimson Skull
- now placed at 14 Prestige Point -

Much congratulations to easilyamused, and for this first year, it seems like Khorne reigns in the Wasteland!
... although jdmickleburgh and his Slaanesh are only behind with one single point ...
