Hello coaches!

Our fourth, somewhat impromptu smaller region, has now been completed - Kingdoms of Ind, Lumbria and the Hinterlands of Khuresh! Time to see what achievements are to be handed out there...


Snake Charmer - Awarded to best players of the Ind, Lumbria and Khuresh Regionals. Worth 1 Prestige Point to the team as long as that player is on the team.

- Sun Eater (Dandaka Devas)
- Vima Taktu (Bhubaneswar Rampage)


Triple X - Awarded to player hitting 3+ casualties in one match. Worth 1 Prestige Point to the team as long as that player is on the team.

- Sun Eater (Dandaka Devas) (in this match vs Flying Drop Bears)

(Just so we are all clear how this works. These players are now look upon with extra regard by the CabalVision fans and CabalVision itself. They are worth Prestige as long as they are on the team. If they are ever retired or killed, the team drops in Prestige. What this means is that a coach might have to think carefully about when to retire such a player if they might carry injuries. In addition, the following should be noted by everyone: killing a player with an award like this is something worth your while.)

That brings us to the rankings as follows:


Flying Drop Bears
- now placed at 3 Prestige Points -


Dandaka Devas
- now placed at 11 Prestige Points -


Bhubaneswar Rampage
- now placed at 12 Prestige Points -

CabalVision would like to congratulate wallenstein, for the victory in this region, even if it is only a very closely fought victory!
