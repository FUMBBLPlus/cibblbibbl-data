SCRIBBL Climax Qualifiers



Location: Home and Away Stadiums of Teams.

Participants:
- Everyone is invited to the ten Qualifiers, to earn a spot for the SCRIBBL Climax, with the ten winners taking a spot for next year's major event. The other ten spots are filled through various other ways (in Autumn and as final additions before the event itself).
- Qualifiers are filled in a secret and complex method, of which the formula is not public knowledge. However, the general guideline bases itself on three major principles. One is that teams of higher prestige tend be sorted more towards the lower numbers and lower prestige tends to be sorted more towards the higher numbers. The other guidelines sorts teams by style, theme and non-regionality, and then divides this over the tournaments - which will result in comparatively fresh, original match-ups and a healthy mix of team types and styles throughout the tournaments.

Tournament format:
Swiss, 5 rounds.

Prestige Points are awarded as follows:
• SCRIBBL Climax Qualifier 4th place: +1
• SCRIBBL Climax Qualifier 3rd place: +3
• SCRIBBL Climax Qualifier 2nd place: +6
• SCRIBBL Climax Qualifier 1st place: +9
