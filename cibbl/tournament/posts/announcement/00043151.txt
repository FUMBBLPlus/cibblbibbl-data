Summer is here!

First deadline is 19th of May (11 days from now), following deadlines will be more or less 10 days after each time. However, we will be easy with deadlines in the upcoming time, as people are dealing with summer holidays and such, although we would still very gladly hear of them whenever applicable.

There are two Filler spots for any late Summer joiner - one of which I definitely want to fill in the Little Cup. Feel free to ask a friend, as always.

Coach Teppich (Bigwood Tree Shmashaz),
please choose which one of these teams you want to partner up with in the other Conjoined Blue Eagle tournament:

- Forsaken of the Pantheon
- Talsyn Tramplers
- Goblin Revolushunary Kommittee
- Blood-Ground Blackhorns
- Albion­­ Manticores
- Coven of the Mirrored Hall
- Trantio Dragon Hawks
- Oyxl Great Pyramid Heroes

I'd say we partner with Blood-Ground Blackhorns - they seem like fellow brawler

I was tempted to pick Trantio Dragon Hawks for the good ol Old World comradery, but thought that might be a bit too regionalistish.

You are in the Conjoined Blue Eagle tournament, where you need to pair with another team.

You've got the choice out of the six teams mentioned in my previous post to become your partner. If you're still confused, come to Discord and ask!

Tough choice, as Poshgit's Daredevils wander into strange and changing territory. Surely Coven of the Mirrored Hall are best-suited to guide us through!

The knights turn their noses up at the foul smelling snakes and the equally rotten chaos worshippers. A ballot is called and the team almost unanimously spoil their cards or tick "none of the above". However, one of their peasants goes against the grain for reasons that can only be speculated; Dimitri puts a dot in the top most box as that seemed easiest.

Forsaken of the Pantheon.

If only someone had either taught him to read or impressed upon him the need to just cross the whole piece of paper and leave the voting to the nobles.

Dimitri is now said to be volunteered for front line service indefinitely so that he may make up for his mistake... or die trying. Meanwhile the nobles of the team are left grumbling and bemoaning their ill luck.
