Hello coaches!

A third region has now been completed - Cathay and Nippon! Time to see what achievements are to be handed out here...


Oriental Aesthetics - Awarded to best players of the Cathay and Nippon Regionals. Worth 1 Prestige Point to the team as long as that player is on the team.

- Drew Drechsel (Ninja Warriors)
- Jessie Graff (Ninja Warriors)
- Meiko (Secret Cult Of Shiamoto)

(Just so we are all clear how this works. These players are now look upon with extra regard by the CabalVision fans and CabalVision itself. They are worth Prestige as long as they are on the team. If they are ever retired or killed, the team drops in Prestige. What this means is that a coach might have to think carefully about when to retire such a player if they might carry injuries. In addition, the following should be noted by everyone: killing a player with an award like this is something worth your while.)

That brings us to the rankings as follows:


Secret Cult Of Shiamoto
- now placed at 3 Prestige Points -


Grand Celestial Delegate
- now placed at 5 Prestige Points -


Lords of the Silent Death
- now placed at 9 Prestige Points -


Ninja Warriors
- now placed at 18 Prestige Points -

CabalVision would like to congratulate Azure, for a dominating victory in the Cathay and Nippon region!
