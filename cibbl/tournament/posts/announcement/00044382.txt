Grand Cathayan Exotic Creature Challenge



Location: Cathay.

Participants:
- 10 teams, considered as curiosities in Cathay, have been invited to play this special challenge in order to entertain the people. While this is clearly somewhat offensive to these teams to be categorized in this way, the money, prestige and glory, and official CabalVision support, has nonetheless convinced the participants to show up. Participants are separated in two groups of 5. An expert panel of Cathayan poet-planners have separated the participants in two groups, group A is considered the somewhat more exquisite group (whatever that means) - and expected to draw more attention - and its tickets are sold at a slightly higher price.

Expected entrants: 2x5.

Tournament format: Round Robin, 4 rounds. Open Round Robin used for final round, where teams from both groups meet.

Special rules:
- Groups play first four rounds within their own group.
- In final round, teams from group A play against group B, based on their performance of the first four rounds.
- Ultimate victory is granted to the highest ranked winning team of final round. If in final round the highest ranked match-up results in a draw, then the ultimate victory goes to a lower ranked match-up. A draw in the final round will not earn a team the final prize.
