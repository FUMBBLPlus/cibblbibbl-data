Hello coaches!

Our final region has now been completed - Southlands and Araby is finally completed! Time to see what achievements are to be handed out there...


Southland Salvation - Awarded to best players of the Southlands and Araby Regionals. Worth 1 Prestige Point to the team as long as that player is on the team.

- Boqinzi (Teotiqua Oracles)
- Zuberi the lazy (Southland Scuttlers)
- Wasswa Legbreaker (Southland Scuttlers)

Fame Killer (Image Not Available Yet, Coming ASAP)
Fame Killer - Awarded to player killing a induced Star Player. Worth 1 Prestige Point to the team as long as that player is on the team.

- Wasswa Legbreaker (Southland Scuttlers) (in this match vs Nejaz Djinn)

(Just so we are all clear how this works. These players are now look upon with extra regard by the CabalVision fans and CabalVision itself. They are worth Prestige as long as they are on the team. If they are ever retired or killed, the team drops in Prestige. What this means is that a coach might have to think carefully about when to retire such a player if they might carry injuries. In addition, the following should be noted by everyone: killing a player with an award like this is something worth your while.)

That brings us to the rankings as follows:

5th place.
Bigg Rokk Bigg Buffaluff Headz
- now placed at 0 Prestige Points -


Teotiqua Oracles
- now placed at 5 Prestige Points -


Guardians of the Lurking God
- now placed at 10 Prestige Points -


Nejaz Djinn
- now placed at 14 Prestige Points -


Southland Scuttlers
- now placed at 20 Prestige Points -

CabalVision would like to congratulate CrudeDoodle, for their victory in this region!
