- The Pearl Chalice -


The Obsidian Chalice is a tournament organized in the Orient, alongside the Pearl Chalice, together forming a kind of Yin-Yang relationship. CabalVision has decided to have these tournaments set up and organized here, after Winter turned out to be such a dominant affair already for teams from this side of the globe.
The teams invited for the Obsidian Chalice are known for their ways of power, for causing bloodshed, and for being feared for their prowess. On the other hand, the teams of the Pearl Chalice make up the other side of the spectrum.
Invitations for these tournaments were based on overall casualty differences.

The Obsidian Chalice is played with a Spiked Ball!

The Obsidian Chalice is a swiss tournament for eight teams.
The Pearl Chalice is a scheduled round robin tournament for six teams.

Prestige Points are awarded as follows:
• Obsidian/Pearl Chalice 4th place: +1
• Obsidian/Pearl Chalice 3rd place: +3
• Obsidian/Pearl Chalice 2nd place: +5
• Obsidian/Pearl Chalice 1st place: +8

In addition, CabalVision would like to announce that at the end of the tournament, a special Achievement will be awarded to the two winning teams of these tournaments. In the future, any time these two teams meet on the pitch, they play for 5 additional prestige points, which the loser deducts from their total and the victor adds. This will happen until the Chalices have found new champions in the future.

In addition, CabalVision would also like to announce that access to two new Star Players (one for Pearl, one for Obsidian) will be granted to certain teams, depending on their performances during the tournament.
