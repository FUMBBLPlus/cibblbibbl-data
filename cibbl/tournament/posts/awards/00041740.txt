Hello coaches!

The Old World has been completed - great! Time to see what achievements are to be handed out here...


Old World Values - Awarded to best players of the Old World Regionals. Worth 1 Prestige Point to the team as long as that player is on the team.

- Zunrec Greatbone (Trantio Dragon Hawks)
- Bernardo Suerte (Montetriste Noblemen)
- Iván Petróvitj Ptítsyn (Spartak Bolgasgrad)
- Oedia (Trantio Dragon Hawks)


Triple X - Awarded to player hitting 3+ casualties in one match. Worth 1 Prestige Point to the team as long as that player is on the team.

- Zunrec Greatbone (Trantio Dragon Hawks) (in this match vs Carcassonne Knights)

(Just so we are all clear how this works. These players are now look upon with extra regard by the CabalVision fans and CabalVision itself. They are worth Prestige as long as they are on the team. If they are ever retired or killed, the team drops in Prestige. What this means is that a coach might have to think carefully about when to retire such a player if they might carry injuries. In addition, the following should be noted by everyone: killing a player with an award like this is something worth your while.)


That brings us to the rankings as follows:


Carcassonne Knights
- now placed at 1 Prestige Point -


Spartak Bolgasgrad
- now placed at 7 Prestige Point -


Trantio Dragon Hawks
- now placed at 14 Prestige Point -


Montetriste Noblemen
- now placed at 17 Prestige Point -

CabalVision would like to congratulate Burnalot, for a total victory in the Old World! That said, the Trantio Dragon Hawks have had an impressive showing as well, winning two games and collecting three Achievements!
