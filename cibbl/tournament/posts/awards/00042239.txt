Hello CabalVision viewers and team coaches!

Time for the award ceremony of the Great Ocean! Time to see what achievements are to be handed out there...


Crushing Victory
Awarded whenever a team scores at least 4 times, while the opponent scores no touchdowns at all. Worth 1 Prestige Point to the team, but will 'decay' like normally earned Prestige Points.
- Doom of Athelorn (in match vs Blackmud Tridents)


Wave Rider
Awarded to best players of the Great Ocean Regionals. Worth 1 Prestige Point to the team as long as that player is on the team.
- S. Sang
- Ansodhil
- Urien The Heartripper

(Just so we are all clear how this works. These players are now look upon with extra regard by the CabalVision fans and CabalVision itself. They are worth Prestige as long as they are on the team. If they are ever retired or killed, the team drops in Prestige. What this means is that a coach might have to think carefully about when to retire such a player if they might carry injuries. In addition, the following should be noted by everyone: killing a player with an award like this is something worth your while.)

That brings us to the rankings as follows:


Blackmud Tridents
- now placed at 2 Prestige Points -


Norscan Curse
- now placed at 5 Prestige Points -


Tor Anroc Anglers
- now placed at 13 Prestige Points -


Doom of Athelorn
- now placed at 16 Prestige Points -

The CIBBL front page, team list and Trophy Case have been updated accordingly.
CabalVision would like to congratulate Mr_Foxx, for their victory in this region!
